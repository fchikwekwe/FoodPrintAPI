## FoodPrint API Content
Have you ever wanted to improve your overall carbon output, but were not sure how to do it? Use the FoodPrint API! This API is a food tracker that tells your your carbon output based each food you have eaten.

## Why did you make FoodPrint in the first place?
Food is a huge contributor to CO2 emissions and its also a very personal way to help prevent global warming. We feel that if people are aware how much each individual food items contributes in CO2 output to climate change, they will be more able to make changes.

## Back-End Design
This project was developed using MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js in the back-end. We used resourceful and RESTful routing throughout and integrated authentication concepts. It also has test coverage with Mocha and Chai.

## Running
This project can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/. To check it out, type the command 'npm start' into your console from the root folder. If you would like to check out the current, live version of FoodPrint, go to https://know-your-foodprint.herokuapp.com/.

## Are there other ways to learn more about Foodprint?
Javier Mendoza (@javiermms) and I were the developers on the original application. We also published a blog series (https://bit.ly/2GaQSa1) about our development process on this app. You can see a live user demo here https://vimeo.com/305850006.
